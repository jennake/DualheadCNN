# DualheadCNN
Developed a custom convolutional neural network with dual outputs to both classify galaxy mergers and estimate photometric redshifts based on image input. The project leveraged large astronomical datasets to train and validate performance, with particular attention to convolutional depth, regularisation, and data augmentation.
